* Flaskr - Intro to Flask, TDD and JS

What to learn
1. Difference between GET and POST
2. What are HTTP requests and responses
3. How HTML Pages are rendered and/or returned to the user

* TDD
[[https://testdriven.io/test-driven-development/][Test-Driven Development]]
1. Write Tests
2. Run the Test (should fail)
3. Write just enough code for the test to pass
4. Refactor code and retest, again and again

* Database
1. Create a schema.sql file
2. Update app with configuration
   - Here, we created a configuration section for config variables (with the name of the future SQLite database) and loaded the config after app initialization.
   - test existence of a file
   - *This is a test-driven test* the file doesn't exist yet, so it needs to
     fail first
